(** Establish trust in community repositories

    Conex is a library to verify and attest package release integrity and
    authenticity through the use of cryptographic signatures.

    Each author cryptographically signs a list of resources (own public key,
    package releases) they vouch for.  The {{!Conex_repository.t}repository} is
    a map where resource digests are the key, and the set of warrantors the
    value.  Verification of the signature is done via
    {{!Conex_verify.S.verify}verify}.

    Given a {{!Conex_utils.LOGS}logs} and a {{!Conex_verify.S}verify}
    implementation, this modules provides functionality to verify identities and
    packages.  All functions require {{!Conex_io.t}IO} explicitly.

  (** [verify_id io repo id] reads [id] from [io] unless [id] is already part of

      [repo]. *)

      all its team members.  It verifies in two steps: first it uses only those
      public keys which fingerprints are [valid].  If successful, in a second
      step the resulting repository is used to verify the remaining janitors,
      followed by verification of the janitor team. *)

  (** [verify_package ~ignore_missing io repo name] reads and verifies the
      authorisation of the package [name].  All [ids] who are authorised are
      loaded into the repository (using {!verify_ids}).  The package data for
      [name] is read and verified, followed by all releases.  Each release is
      read and verified. If [ignore_missing] is true, packages with missing
      authorisations or package indexes are ignored. *)

      and applies it.  The key fingerprints ofjanitors in [repository] are used
      to validate the janitors team of the repository with applied [patch].  All
      identifiers and packages of the repository with [patch] applied are
      verified, and additionally all modified resources have their monotonicity
      verified.  If [ignore_missing] is true, packages with missing
      authorisations and package indexes are ignored. *)
